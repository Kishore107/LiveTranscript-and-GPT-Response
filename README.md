# Live Transcription with ChatGPT

## Overview

This project implements a live audio transcription system that utilizes OpenAI's GPT to generate responses based on the transcribed text. It captures audio from the microphone, processes it in real-time, and displays both the transcriptions and the corresponding responses in a user-friendly GUI.

## Features

- **Real-Time Transcription**: Converts spoken audio into text as you speak.
- **ChatGPT Integration**: Sends transcriptions to the OpenAI API to generate relevant responses.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using CustomTkinter for a modern and interactive UI.
- **Multi-threaded Processing**: Uses threads to handle audio capturing and UI updates seamlessly.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language for the project.
- **SpeechRecognition**: For capturing and transcribing audio.
- **OpenAI API**: For generating responses from the ChatGPT model.
- **CustomTkinter**: For creating a responsive graphical user interface.
